<h1>Alex's favourite movies</h1>
<h2>A few of my favourite films of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h1>Inception</h1>
<p>Beautifully orchestrated music and mind boggling effects and twists makes this film one the best films ever made in my opinion</p>
<br />
<h1>The Maze Runner</h1>
<p>So fantasticly frantic that it had me clenching my seat the first time I saw it.</p>
<br/>
<h1>John Wick</h1>
<p>Awesome choreography during fight scenes, with a nice story.</p>
